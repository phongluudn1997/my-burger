<p>React batches state updates - see:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10231#issuecomment-316644950" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10231#issuecomment-316644950</a></p><p>That simply means that calling</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">setName('Max');
setAge(30);</pre><p>in the same synchronous (!) execution cycle (e.g. in the same function) will <strong>NOT&nbsp;trigger two component re-render cycles</strong>.</p><p>Instead, the component will <strong>only re-render once</strong> and both state updates will be <strong>applied simultaneously</strong>.</p><p>Not directly related, but also sometimes misunderstood, is when the new state value is available.</p><p>Consider this code:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">console.log(name);&nbsp;// prints name state, e.g. 'Manu'
setName('Max');
console.log(name);&nbsp;//&nbsp;???&nbsp;what gets printed? 'Max'?</pre><p>You could think that accessing the name state after <code>setName('Max');</code> should yield the new value (e.g. <code>'Max'</code>) but this is <strong>NOT the case</strong>. Keep in mind, that the <strong>new state value is only available in the next component render cycle</strong> (which gets scheduled by calling <code>setName()</code>).</p><p><strong>Both concepts (batching and when new state is available)&nbsp;behave in the same way for both functional components with hooks as well as class-based components with </strong><code><strong>this.setState()</strong></code><strong>!</strong></p>
