<p>You learned about <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>&nbsp;, you learned about the <code>to</code>&nbsp; property it uses.</p>

<p>The path you can use in to can be either <strong>absolute</strong> or <strong>relative</strong>.&nbsp;</p>





































<h4><strong>Absolute Paths</strong></h4>





































<p>By default, if you just enter <code>to="/some-path"</code>&nbsp; or <code>to="some-path"</code>&nbsp;, that's an <strong>absolute path</strong>.&nbsp;</p>





































<p><strong>Absolute path</strong>&nbsp;means that it's<strong> always appended right after your domain</strong>. Therefore, both syntaxes (with and without leading slash) lead to <code>example.com/some-path</code>&nbsp;.</p>





































<h4><strong>Relative Paths</strong></h4>





































<p>Sometimes, you might want to create a relative path instead. This is especially useful, if your component is already loaded given a specific path (e.g. <code>posts</code>&nbsp;) and you then want to append something to that existing path (so that you, for example, get <code>/posts/new</code>&nbsp;).</p>





































<p>If you're on a component loaded via <code>/posts</code>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<code>to="new"</code>&nbsp; would lead to <code>example.com/new</code>&nbsp;, <strong>NOT</strong> <code>example.com/posts/new</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>





































<p>To change this behavior, you have to find out which path you're on and add the new fragment to that existing path. You can do that with the <code>url</code>&nbsp; property of <code>props.match</code>&nbsp;:</p>





































<p><code>&lt;Link to={props.match.url + '/new'}&gt;</code>&nbsp; will lead to <code>example.com/posts/new</code>&nbsp; when placing this link in a component loaded on <code>/posts</code>&nbsp;. If you'd use the same <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>&nbsp; in a component loaded via <code>/all-posts</code>&nbsp;, the link would point to <code>/all-posts/new</code>&nbsp;.</p>





































<p><strong>There's no better or worse way of creating Link paths</strong> - choose the one you need. Sometimes, you want to ensure that you always load the same path, no matter on which path you already are =&gt;&nbsp;Use absolute paths in this scenario.</p>





































<p>Use relative paths if you want to navigate relative to your existing path.</p>
