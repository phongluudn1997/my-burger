<p>We installed both <code>react-router</code>&nbsp; and <code>react-router-dom</code>&nbsp;. <strong>T</strong><strong>echnically, only <code>react-router-dom</code>&nbsp; is required for web development</strong>. It wraps <code>react-router</code>&nbsp; and therefore uses it as a dependency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We <strong>don't need to install </strong><code>react-router</code>&nbsp; on our own for it to work. You can omit this installation step, I left it in there for historic reasons and because I&nbsp;like to emphasize that the main package is named react-router. If you ever search for assistance, you probably want to search for "react router" - that's the name of the package.</p>
