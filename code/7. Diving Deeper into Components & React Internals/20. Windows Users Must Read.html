<p><strong>On Windows</strong>, the <code>Aux.js</code>  filename is not allowed in ZIP archives. Hence when extracting the attached source code, you might get prompted to rename the <code>Aux.js</code>  file. You might also <strong>face difficulties creating an Aux folder</strong> and Aux.js file.</p><p> I really apologize for that inconvenience, Windows is really doing an amazing job here ;-).</p><p>Follow these fixes:</p><h4><strong>1) Problems when unzipping the attached file:</strong></h4><p>Simply <strong>skip this step</strong> (e.g. by pressing <strong>"No"</strong>) and <strong>ignore</strong> the upcoming error message.</p><p>In the extracted folder, you'll then find <strong>all source files</strong> EXCEPT for the <code>Aux.js</code>  file. In later course modules (where we work on the course project), the <code>Aux.js</code>  file can be found in an <code>Aux/</code>  subfolder inside <code>hoc/</code> .</p><p>Make sure to take the <code>Aux.js</code>  file <strong>attached to this lecture</strong> and place it inside the <code>hoc/</code>  or <code>hoc/Aux/</code>  folder (which ever of the two you got).</p><h4><strong>2) Problems with the creation of an Aux folder and/ or file:</strong></h4><p>Simply name both differently. For example, you may create an <code>Auxiliary</code>  folder and name the file inside of it <code>Auxiliary.js</code> . Make sure to then adjust your imports (<code>import Aux from './path/to/Auxiliary/Auxiliary'</code> ) and you should be fine.</p><p><br></p>
