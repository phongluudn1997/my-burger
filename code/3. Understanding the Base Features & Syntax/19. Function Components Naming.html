<p>In the <strong>next lecture</strong>, we'll learn how to manage state in functional components (instead of class-based components).</p><p>In case you're getting an error with the code shown in the next lecture, simply assign a capitalized variable name to the variable that holds your functional component.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>Use </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const App = () =&gt; { ... }</pre><p>instead of</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const app = () =&gt; { ... }</pre><p>Technically, that's not required but depending on your project setup, the built-in linter (a code quality checking tool) that comes with create-react-app might not like the lowercase variable name.</p><p>You can also avoid this by creating projects with the <strong>right react-scripts version</strong>, which I would <strong>recommend for this course</strong> anyways (see the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/14320208" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setup video, lecture 26</a>)</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">create-react-app my-app --scripts-version 1.1.5</pre>
